title: "Code Europe: Protect your code with GitHub's security features"
date: 2022-05-30

I have the pleasure of speaking at [Code Europe](https://www.codeeurope.pl/en/speakers/rob-bos) and these are the slides for it:

Creating modern software has a lot of moving parts. We all build on top of the shoulders of giants by leveraging closed/open source packages or containers that other people have shared. That makes securing our software a lot more complex as well!

In this session you'll learn what possible attack vectors you need to look for, how to protect yourself against them and how to leverage GitHub's features to make your life easier!

Topics:

- Signed Commits
- Dependabot updates
- Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities
- Secret scanning (and revoking) out of the box
- Using CodeQL
